# Memi's Scripts
#### A horrid zone full of terrible scripts I make for fun.

Hi. Welcome to my dumb zone of `scripts` I make for fun, or for something. These'll use any language, and are meant to be taken at little levels. I am not gonna be responsible for whoever uses these, even if I don't make malicious scripts. Thanks for reading!

## Scripts
### `gate-guardian.sh`
A script that doesn't let you use uwu, if you set it to the right alias, then it'll make sense.

#### Setup/Usage
```sh
alias uwu="chmod +x ./gate-guardian.sh && ./gate-guardian.sh || exit"
uwu # no uwu in my zone
```

### `calculator.cpp`
A calculator a friend helped me create, him mostly doing the work; since I'm more newer to C++.

#### Setup/Usage
```
# will show soon
```
___
### `Collection.js`
I'm constantly using this in my JS applications whenever possible.

#### Setup/Usage
```js
const Collection = require(__dirname + "/directory & path of collection.js");
const coll = new Collection();
```
___
### `batch-spam.bat`
This was some dumb script I made out of nowhere, citing "educational teaching" as the purpose.
It's really bad, since it's from 2017.

#### Setup/Usage
```
literally just run the file on a Windows PC.
```

### `rethink-install.sh`
I wanted to install RethinkDB to multiple sources, so I made a basic script for such. I may turn it into a CLI, and a menu; because how it looks is really damn ugly right now.

```sh
alias rethink-install="curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memimoe/Scriptz/master/rethink-install | bash"
rethink-install
```
