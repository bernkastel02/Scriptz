# Memi's Scripts
#### A horrid zone full of terrible scripts I make for fun.

Hi. Welcome to my dumb zone of `scripts` I make for fun, or for something. These'll use any language, and are meant to be taken at little levels. I am not gonna be responsible for whoever uses these, even if I don't make malicious scripts. Thanks for reading!

## Scripts
### `gate-guardian.sh`
A script that doesn't let you use uwu, if you set it to the right alias, then it'll make sense.

#### Setup
```sh
alias uwu="chmod +x ./gate-guardian.sh && ./gate-guardian.sh || exit"
```

### `calculator.cpp`
A calculator a friend helped me create, him mostly doing the work; since I'm more newer to C++.

#### Setup
```
# will show soon
```
___
### `Collection.js`
I'm constantly using this in my JS applications whenever possible.

#### Setup
```js
const Collection = require(__dirname + "/directory & path of collection.js");
```
